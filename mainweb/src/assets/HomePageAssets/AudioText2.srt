1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,460
Zoo is a young woman struggling with
substance abuse, trying to turn her life

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,889
around. The problem is that she is unable
to find the courage to take responsibility

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:16,549
for her actions and make real change.
Zoo finds herself in debt and begins looking

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,700
for a loophole, a way to repay the debt
with money she doesn't have to work for.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,039
She assumes since her grandmother's
passing that she could use money

6
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:29,899
from the will to pay the debt, only
to find out that her grandmother did not

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,450
leave her any money. Her grandmother
left her something else. Zoo was left with

8
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:42,810
the custody of her autistic half
sister named Music. Initially, zoo is not able

9
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:48,430
to properly care for or love music.
Their relationship is empty and troubled.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,020
One day, in the midst of yelling and crying,
the neighbor knocked on the door

11
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,580
to see what was going on. Zo said to the neighbor
while sounding defeated, How

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,590
am I supposed to take care of music
when I can't even take care of myself? Day

13
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:11,059
after day, music sits in the apartment
with her headphones on, feeling alone,

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,370
even though Ziu is sitting an arm's
length away. Music is unsure what to think.

15
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,459
She's not ready to engage in any sort
of relationship with you because there was no

16
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:26,900
expression of devotion, care
or appreciation for her. Finally,

17
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,260
Tsou attempts to start loving
music. However, she does so rationally

18
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,020
and strategically, she attempts to check
the boxes, provide food for her, give

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,470
her toys and the opportunity to watch
TV. It is a negotiated agreement that

20
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:49,089
is a transaction of you do X and I'll
do Y, and that should equal love.

21
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:57,639
But it doesn't work. As a lyric in the movie
goes, come on, give me some Stevie

22
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:03,340
Wonder meaning, could you find the ability
to love that is not based on anything

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,739
physical, not based on a contractual
agreement. It is a feeling of love

24
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:14,759
for something that you may not
necessarily be able to see. Again, Tsou does try

25
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,360
to will a feeling of love upon herself
and force better behaviors into her life,

26
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,250
hoping that would lead to this
powerful feeling of love. But it doesn't work

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,759
in debt. And wishing she could
properly take care of music, Tsou finally breaks

28
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,339
down. She cries in frustration
because she is not able to connect with music.

29
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,860
She throws books across the room in anger
because she is unhappy with who she has

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,399
become. She wants to be better, but has
not been able to make real changes

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,669
to improve herself. Then one
afternoon, music is sitting at the kitchen table,

32
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,599
hyper focused on drawing Tsou
standing across the room, notices that her blue

33
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:03,459
headphones are about to fall off
while music continues to draw vigorously with

34
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:10,039
her head down, Zo walks over, bends
down and readjusts her headphones. Music looks

35
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:16,099
up, taking a break from her important
drawing. She cracks a little smile just

36
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,580
enough to barely show her teeth
and her eyes squint ever so slightly,

37
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:29,160
something Tsou had never seen before.
Zoo feels a warmth, a connection, an energy.

38
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:35,869
She forgets about her worries for a brief
moment. The next morning, Zoo wanted

39
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,639
to experience that feeling again, she woke
up 20 minutes early to make breakfast

40
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,839
for music, which is usually a last
minute bowl of cereal. Tsou positions the eggs

41
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,549
and ketchup on the plate to make the smiley
face. She then calls music to come

42
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:54,959
to the table for breakfast while
zoo washes the dishes. She looks out

43
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:59,279
the corner of her eye with curiosity
for whether music will notice the smiley face

44
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,199
or not. Not expecting a well-prepared
breakfast music sits down at the kitchen

45
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,970
table, she looks down at her plate
with curiosity and soon discovers what

46
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:15,600
she is looking at. She looks up and smiles
at Tsou, this time a full smile,

47
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:22,250
teeth showing and eyes squinting,
Zo smiled back and then that same feeling

48
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:29,709
came over her. A warmth, a connection.
Her worries vanish, a feeling of desire

49
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:35,079
to improve herself for music takes
over more and more. Zoo found the energy

50
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:41,440
and time to communicate with music, to commit
to music, to empower music, to make

51
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:48,260
music feel loved, encouraged,
wanted. At this point in the movie, Zoo says.

52
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,160
I'm actually learning how to love
because I love her and I'm going to continue

53
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:01,589
because now she is helping me.
Finally, Sue figured it out, the love for music

54
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,429
and the desire to empower music is what
energizes her to change her bad habits.

55
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,510
She was able to go from the person
she was to the person she wanted to be,

56
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:18,489
to the person people needed her to be.
As the lyrics go, you can't love me

57
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,619
unless you love you to. The idea of love
for yourself in this movie is not patting

58
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,790
yourself on the back, buying
yourself something new or lying to yourself

59
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,619
about how great you are. This love is the desire
to make life better for someone

60
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,760
else, and in the attempt to do so,
one must bring about the best in themselves.

61
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,459
In realizing the impact she was making
on music and the fact that she was improving

62
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:50,279
her own life, Tsou felt a strong
purpose and fulfillment which created more energy

63
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,799
to improve herself. Zoo then had the ability
to make sacrifices and withstand

64
00:05:55,899 --> 00:06:01,769
change. Zoo was able to go from thinking
about making change to actually making

65
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:06,779
change. She can go from looking for a reason
to make change, to having every

66
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,929
reason in the world.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We may at times require that you register and/or set up an account to use certain portions of the Services.  In order to do so, you may be provided, or required to choose, a password, user ID, and/or other registration information, including, but not limited to, personal information, given name, email address, date of birth, mailing address, etc. (collectively, “Registration Information”). You agree and represent that all Registration Information provided by you is accurate and up-to-date. If any of your Registration Information changes, you must update it by using the appropriate update mechanism on our Site, if available. If Heroic Minds believes that the Registration Information you provide is not correct, current, or complete, Heroic Minds reserves the right to refuse you access to its Services.  However, Heroic Minds has no obligation to verify the accuracy, currency, completeness or usefulness of any Registration Information that you have provided to us.
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            If you register and/or set up an account on the Services, you will be solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any user ID, password, and similar information. You may not authorize others to use your user ID, password, or similar information. You are solely responsible for all usage or activity on your account including, but not limited to, use of the account by any person who uses your Registration Information, with or without authorization, or who has access to any computer on which your account resides or is accessible.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (for example, following a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your Registration Information), you must promptly change the affected Registration Information by using the appropriate update mechanism on the Site, if available, or notify us at ben@heroicminds.live or as described in our Privacy Policy.  We will not be responsible for the unauthorized use of your profile by any other person and disclaim any and all liability that may be associated with such use.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We have the right, in our sole discretion, to cancel your user ID and password without notice to you.

                            <br />
                            Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Services as permitted by the features of the Services.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The Services are licensed, not sold, to you. Except as expressly provided for in these Terms, Heroic Minds reserves all rights, title and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            You may use our Services for your own personal, non-commercial use, and you may not use our Services for any other purpose without Heroic Minds’s express prior written consent.  For example, you may not (and may not authorize any other party) to: (i) co-brand our Services; (ii) frame our Site; or (iii) hyperlink to our Site, without the express prior written permission of an authorized representative of Heroic Minds. For purposes of these Terms, “co-branding” means to display any name, logo, trademark, or other means of attribution or identification of any party in such a manner as is reasonably likely to give a user the impression that such other party has the right to display, publish, or distribute our Services or which may confuse a user as the nature of the relationship between any party and Heroic Minds. You agree to cease and desist causing any unauthorized co-branding, framing or hyperlinking upon notice from Heroic Minds and at all times you will cooperate with Heroic Minds following Heroic Minds’s discovery of any such illegal activity.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Heroic Minds may, at any time and without notice to you, suspend, disable, limit or terminate access or use of all or part of the Services for any reason and without any liability to you whatsoever. While Heroic Minds takes great care to ensure the Services are accurate, errors and/or inaccuracies may occur. Heroic Minds may change or update information on the Site at any time without notice, and availability of the Services. We make no representations that the Services are compatible with, or will function or operate with your device or equipment.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The Services may be provided via a freemium model and/or via paid subscriptions and fee-based services. While the use of a freemium account is free of charge, premium content and services must be paid for by the user. Features of the Services are subject to constant development and expansion, therefore we reserves the right to change, delete, add or offer its users content in a premium subscription from within a freemium model. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for the payment of any additional purchases offered within the Services.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            From time to time we may offer certain promotional periods to users. Promotions will have the duration and applicable terms communicated to user at the time the promotion is offered. Promotions may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion and may be subject to additional or different terms. Unless we expressly communicate otherwise, promotions are not transferable, may not be combined with other offers or redeemed for cash and are void where prohibited.

                            <br />
                            Some areas of the Services allow you to post or provide content such as profile information, images, and other content or information (any such materials a user submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service is referred to as “User Content”). When you access certain features on our Services that allow you to post and communicate with other users, we urge you not to share any personal information, confidential information or any other information that you would not want to share with the general public.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            You agree to only post User Content to which you own all proprietary right, title and interest, or have a license or written consent from the owner to post such User Content on or through the Services. You grant Heroic Minds a worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid, non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, publicly perform, publicly display, publish, distribute, and create derivative works of any User Content.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We may, but have no obligation to, review User Content before it is posted and we may refuse to post any User Content for any reason in our sole discretion.  Additionally, we may, but we have no obligation to, monitor User Content already posted on the Site or Services. We may, but have no obligation to, edit or remove any User Content that we, in our sole discretion, determine to violate any applicable law, these Terms, or the purpose of our Services, or that we determine to be offensive or inappropriate or for any other reason in our sole discretion. The user content you create remains yours; however, by providing user content through the Services, you agree to allow others within the Services to view your user content within the Services as permitted by the functionality of the Services, your settings and this Agreement.

                            <br />
                            <br />

                            Our Services may also contain information or materials (“Third Party Content”) that are owned or provided by persons other than Heroic Minds (“Third Party Providers”).  Heroic Minds makes no representations and warranties with respect to any such Third Party Content and does not undertake to conduct any independent investigation of Third Party Content.

You understand that you have no proprietary rights in the Third Party Content and that the Third Party Providers retain all proprietary right, title or interest, including copyright, in their respective Third Party Content.
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            You agree at all times to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Heroic Minds, its employees, contractors, agents, officers, directors,  successors and assigns (the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any claims, losses, judgements, actions, proceedings, damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable legal and other fees and disbursements) incurred by any of the foregoing parties due to or resulting from your use or misuse of our Site, Services, our Documentation or from your violation of these Terms. You will also indemnify and hold the Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any claims brought by third parties arising out of your use of our Services.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            These Terms and any action related thereto or related to our Site, Services or Documentation shall be governed, controlled, interpreted and defined by and under the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Embedded Links: Throughout our Services, you may find embedded links posted on other users profiles that may direct you outside of Heroic Minds. Although we allow the use of embedded links, we cannot guarantee that (a) these links are free of malware and viruses and (b) the links posted all contain appropriate, safe content. Although Heroic Minds works to best monitor the links being posted, we do not review all external links on our Service. It is to your discretion whether you use the embedded links posted by other users. Users that include embedded links on their profile are solely responsible for the links that are posted, and Heroic Minds will not be held liable.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Third Party Links: The Services may contain links to other websites; for instance, user profiles, and other posts may link to other sites. When you access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. Heroic Minds does not control or endorse those sites. Users that include third party links on their profile, or that are the source of the third party links are solely responsible for the links that are posted, and Heroic Minds will not be held liable.

                            14.0 Termination and Miscellaneous
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Termination of platform: We may, without prior notice, change the Services; add additional features to the service; stop providing features of the Services, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Services. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Services without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we will try to notify you beforehand – but this won’t always be possible. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement, and you become ineligible to create a new account.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Communication of updates: Heroic Minds may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on the platform, as determined by Heroic Minds at our judgement. Heroic Minds reserves the right to provide notifications in whichever manner we see fit, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Heroic Minds is not responsible for any automatic filtering that you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Heroic Minds may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and you will receive immediate notice upon first sign-in after we make the changes. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page. Your continued use of the Service will occur after any such change with your updated consent of the new Terms. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Assignment: These Terms are personal to you. You cannot assign them, transfer them, or sublicense them unless you get Heroic Minds’s prior written consent. Heroic Minds has the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations under these Terms without notice and without your consent.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Severability: If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Headings: The headings used in these Terms are included for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of these Terms.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            No Waiver: Heroic Minds will not be considered to have waived any of its rights or remedies described in these Terms unless the waiver is in writing and signed by Heroic Minds.  No delay or omission by Heroic Minds in exercising its rights or remedies will impair or be construed as a waiver.  Any single or partial exercise of a right or remedy will not preclude further exercise of any other right or remedy.  Heroic Minds’s failure to enforce the strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of Heroic Minds’s right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provisions of these Terms.

                            If we do not act to enforce a breach of these Terms, that does not mean that Heroic Minds has waived its right to enforce these Terms. You may not assign or transfer this contract (or your account membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that Heroic Minds may assign this contract to its affiliates or a party that purchases it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this contract.

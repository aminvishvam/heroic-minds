                    We may, from time to time, expand or reduce our business and this may
                    involve the sale and/or the transfer of control of all or part of our
                    business. Data provided by users will, where it is relevant to any
                    part of our business be transferred along with the transferred part of

                    this privacy policy, be permitted to use the data for the purposes for
                    which it was originally collected by us. In the event that any of your
                    data is to be transferred in such a manner, you will not be notified
                    in advance.

                    our Services in accordance with the contractual relationship between
                    you and us;
                    <br />
                    The processing of your data is required for us to comply with our
                    legal obligations, including maintaining records which we may legally

                    DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
                    <br />
                    We may disclose your information to our representatives, affiliates,
                    suppliers or other third parties with which we do business (our
                    “Business Partners”) when it is deemed necessary for our business
                    operations. For example, from time to time, we may engage companies or
                    individuals for certain services on our behalf including, without
                    limitation, conducting audits, performing legal services, processing
                    credit card payments, collecting feedback, and providing customer
                    service. Our Business Partners and any other third-party service
                    providers will only have incidental access to personal information to
                    the extent required to perform their services. They are prohibited
                    from the use of your personal information for any purpose other than
                    assisting with our business operations.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We may also disclose your information as necessary to protect the
                    safety or security of users of our Services, to detect and prevent
                    fraud or abusive behaviour, or when otherwise required or permitted by
                    law.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Further, if required, we may disclose your information to supervisory
                    authorities, tax authorities, police and other regulatory authorities
                    as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other
                    legally valid inquiry or order;
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    to either prevent/minimize a criminal offense or to protect a person’s
                    rights and personal and or financial health; and
                    <br />
                    an intellectual property rights owners or such party’s representative
                    if a room ad may be considered, in good faith by such owner, to
                    violate owner’s rights; provided however the owner will be required to
                    enter into an agreement to limit the use of the personal information
                    provided only for purposes of the possible violation of an
                    intellectual property right.
                    <br />
                    In addition to permissions already granted under this privacy policy
                    by you, we may provide, disclose or transfer your personal information
                    with your consent provided either as a part of the Services or in
                    writing by you otherwise.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    disclosure of your personal information at any time by contacting us
                    at the coordinates provided below. Your withdrawal of consent is not
                    retroactive, since we may already have used your information for the
                    purposes described here; it will be applied on a go-forward basis.

                    <br />
                    We may transfer personal information that we collect or that you
                    provide as described in this policy to contractors, service providers,
                    and other third parties we use to support our business (such as
                    analytics and search engine providers that assist us with improvement
                    and optimization of the Services) and who are contractually obligated
                    to keep personal information confidential, use it only for the
                    purposes for which we disclose it to them, and to process the personal
                    information with the same standards set out in this policy.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We may process, store, and transfer your personal information in and
                    to a foreign country, with different privacy laws that may or may not
                    be as comprehensive as Canadian law. In these circumstances, the
                    governments, courts, law enforcement, or regulatory agencies of that
                    country may be able to obtain access to your personal information
                    through the laws of the foreign country. Whenever we engage a service
                    provider, we require that its privacy and security standards adhere to
                    this policy and applicable Canadian privacy legislation.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    By submitting your personal information or engaging with the Site or
                    using our Services, you consent to this transfer, storage, or

                    DATA SECURITY

                    unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We store all
                    information you provide to us behind firewalls on our secure servers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where
                    we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to
                    certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this
                    password confidential. You agree that you shall not to share your
                    password with anyone.

                    <br />
                    Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not
                    completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal
                    information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal
                    information transmitted through our Services. Any transmission of
                    personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for
                    circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained
                    on the Services. We urge you to be careful about giving out
                    information in public areas of the Services such as message boards.

                    Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or
                    regulation, we will only retain your personal information for as long
                    as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including
                    for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
                    requirements. Under some circumstances we may anonymize your personal
                    information so that it can no longer be associated with you. We
                    reserve the right to use such anonymous and de-identified data for any
                    legitimate business purpose without further notice to you or your
                    consent.
